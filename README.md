# Skibidi-Goat-C-GUI-Calculator
This is a goat project  where my team of four people built a Mini Calculator with Graphical User Interface using on pure C with GTK+ toolkit (that sucked ngl) . This project is for our university course Data Structures and Algorithms' mini project to conduct a cool skibidi research and understand more about C programming.
